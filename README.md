# dsBoltzmannMachines

This is the server side R package for using deep Boltzmann machines as generative models in [DataSHIELD](https://github.com/datashield).

The corresponding client side R package is [dsBoltzmannMachinesClient](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/dsBoltzmannMachinesClient).

You can find a first conference abstract about this work here:

There will be a full article available soon.
